**Model name**

Chatham Rise mizer model

**Contacts**

Samik Datta ([samik.datta\@niwa.co.nz](mailto:samik.datta@niwa.co.nz)) 

**Spatial scale forcing**

Regional (shape files provided, mizer is not spatial so no point subdividing the area)

**Levels of gear disaggregation**

Species-specific gears (taken from functional-group level resolution in existing Atlantis model)

**Levels of functional group disaggregation**

Species-specific gears, no functional groups in the Mizer model 

**Spatial grid-cell allocation method**

Summarised across the entire space

**Fishing mortality rate equation**

Fishing mortality by species and across time fed in directly from Atlantis model. Catch rates are computed from assumed biomasses and fishing mortalities.

**Selectivity (size,age,species)**

Selectivity naively assumed to be a function of maturation size for each species.

**Model calibration**

Spawning stock biomass by species taken from Atlantis. Model parameters tuned to match these. 

**Catchability and Creep (yearly rate of change catchability) Estimates**

\[Please provide details on the specific estimated parameters from the calibration, e.g. range of creep of 2-5% per year; and catchability coefficients per gear / functional group as necessary\]

N/A

**Further details on calibration**

Further calibration planned with historical catches and species trends over time using expert opinion.

**Statistical metrics**

\[Please provide detail on the statistical method used in your calibration - E.g. optimisation, error terms\]

**Statistical results (summary)**

\[Please provide a summary of the metrics and results associated with your model calibration - E.g. RMSE with observed catches and any other process-based or theoretical criteria used to calibrate the model, comparison of modelled biomass, growth rates, P\"B ratios etc\]

**Model changes or  improvements(s) made as a result of calibration**

\[Please provide detail of any other parameters or model changes since the last round as a result of this calibration\]\

**ADDITIONAL DETAILS FOR REGIONAL MODELS ONLY:**

**Downscaling method**

\[Please describe further details how the LME level fishing effort was downscaled to your region, providing further information on what data, if any were used, E.g. \]

**The \"base\" year range of the regional model**

\[If you expressed effort relative to the effort in your base model, which year was the base year and how was this done\]
