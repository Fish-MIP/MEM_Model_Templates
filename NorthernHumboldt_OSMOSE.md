**Spatial scale forcing**

Regional, 1/12°

**Levels of gear disaggregation**

Fishing effort by gear, multi-species gears are implemented, different degrees of spatio-temporal resolution. 

**Levels of functional group disaggregation**

Species are explicitly modelled as focal species, other important functional groups are included as background species (spatio-temporal abundance is a forcing)

**Spatial grid-cell allocation method**

Spatial effort based on data, raw data is regridded. Spatial effort is normalised to mean 1 for each time step.

**Fishing mortality rate equation**

**Selectivity (size,age,species)**

Selectivity by size is implemented with several possibilities: knife-edge, logistic, normal and double normal, time varying selectivity is available by providing a time series of parameters and model type. User specified selectivity models are possible 

**Model calibration**

\[Catchability terms can be used to calibrate the model to catches, using data ONLY UP TO 2004. Please state how you estimate these parameters and the metrics and criteria you use to calibrate your model. Please provide details and equations\]

**Catchability and Creep (yearly rate of change catchability) Estimates**

\[Please provide details on the specific estimated parameters from the calibration, e.g. range of creep of 2-5% per year; and catchability coefficients per gear / functional group as necessary\]

**Statistical results (summary)**

\[Please provide a summary of the metrics and results associated with your model calibration - E.g. RMSE with observed catches and any other process-based or theoretical criteria used to calibrate the model, comparison of modelled biomass, growth rates, P\"B ratios etc\]

**Model changes or  improvements(s) made as a result of calibration**

\[Please provide detail of any other parameters or model changes since the last round as a result of this calibration\]

**ADDITIONAL DETAILS FOR REGIONAL MODELS ONLY:**

**Downscaling method**

\[Please describe further details how the LME level fishing effort was downscaled to your region, providing further information on what data, if any were used, E.g. \]

**The \"base\" year range of the regional model**

\[If you expressed effort relative to the effort in your base model, which year was the base year and how was this done\]
