# Spatial scale forcing

Scale: region; Resolution: ¼ and 1 degree model runs

# Levels of gear disaggregation

Species specific fisheries are included through the model, implemented as fishing mortality by species. Recreational fisheries fleets are distinguished from commercial fisheries fleets. 

# Levels of functional group disaggregation

Species specific fisheries (highlighted in bold) are included through the model, implemented as fishing mortality by species based on observed fisheries catch data.

# Spatial grid-cell allocation method

Model does not have spatial resolution. 

# Fishing mortality rate equation

Fishing mortality is used as an input in the model, as calculated by stock assessment models.

# Selectivity (size,age,species)

n/a

# Model calibration

Model is forced with a time series of fisheries mortality and calibrated to observed fisheries catches and observed species biomass from fisheries independent surveys.

# Catchability and Creep (yearly rate of change catchability) Estimates

Catchability and creep are captured by fisheries mortality.

# Further details on calibration

Time series of observed species biomass based on surveys.

# Statistical metrics

Minimization of sum of squares between predicted and observed data through optimization.

# Statistical results (summary)

Minimization of sum of squares between predicted and observed data through optimization.

# Model changes or  improvements(s) made as a result of calibration

Change in vulnerability parameter estimates to produce best fit.

# ADDITIONAL DETAILS FOR REGIONAL MODELS ONLY:

## Downscaling method

Still waiting for fishing effort data.

# The \"base\" year range of the regional model

Base year of model is 1945. Have not yet applied global fishing effort data.

# Environmental and biogeochemical variables and equations

NPP anomaly derived from ESM projections applied to primary producer groups.
