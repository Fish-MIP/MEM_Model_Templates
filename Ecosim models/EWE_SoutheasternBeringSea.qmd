**Spatial scale forcing**

\[For example: scale: global or region, resolution: ¼ and 1 degree model runs\] 

A regional model covering approximately 531,000 sq km of the eastern Bering Sea. The model is not spatially explicit and climate forcing variables in previous work have been averaged over the model area.

**Levels of gear disaggregation**

\[Which gears are used in the model, how was the effort aggregated or disaggregated?\] 

There are nine “gears” included in the model and intended to represent distinct dimensions of living marine resource exploitation within the model region. Records of commercial fisheries catch in Alaska are extensive, with detailed records of catch extending back more than 50 years. As such, we have not used effort in our model calibration or simulations of past ecosystem conditions but have used the recorded catch instead. The trawl fishery is the largest fishery (total catch, t) included in the model and encompasses the vast majority of federally managed groundfish fisheries catch. Additionally, there is a longline fishery for several groundfish, a pot fishery for Pacific cod, and a fishery for Pacific halibut (managed through international treaty, not federally managed as in other groundfish). There are three separate fisheries (i.e., gears) in the model for Pacific salmon, herring, and crabs. Additionally, there are separate fisheries for subsistence and indigenous harvests.

**Levels of functional group disaggregation**

\[Which functional groups are used in the model, how was effort allocated across groups?\] 

There are 69 living functional groups/species included in the model. The observed catch of target species are taken from the recorded catch records. Additionally, there are requirements for recording the catch of non-target species in federally managed fisheries. The recorded catch of non-target species is also included in the model in the same fashion (observed catch) as target species.

**Spatial grid-cell allocation method**

\[How was fishing effort allocated across grid-cells? Please provide equations as well as description\] This model is not spatially explicit.

**Fishing mortality rate equation**

\[How are fishing mortality and catch rates calculated in your model? Please provide equations as well as description\]

Fishing mortality in Rpath is the sum of catches for a species, including landings and discards, divided by the biomass of that species.\

**Selectivity (size,age,species)**

\[If you have a selectivity term please describe it, with equation\] 

We do not have a selectivity term. We do include adult and juvenile pools for selected commercial groundfish species, including walleye pollock, Pacific cod, arrowtooth flounder, Greenland turbot, and Pacific halibut. Fisheries mortality is only inflicted on the adult pools. 

**Model calibration**

\[Catchability terms can be used to calibrate the model to catches, using data ONLY UP TO 2004. Please state how you estimate these parameters and the metrics and criteria you use to calibrate your model. Please provide details and equations\]  

We are fitting the model to biomass time series from resource assessment trawl surveys using log-likelihood, while recognizing there is not enough data to find a unique solution so some additional tuning will be necessary. Model fitting is ongoing work but will be completed in the near future. 

**Catchability and Creep (yearly rate of change catchability) Estimates**

\[Please provide details on the specific estimated parameters from the calibration, e.g. range of creep of 2-5% per year; and catchability coefficients per gear / functional group as necessary\]

**Further details on calibration**

\[Have you used other metrics or data in your calibration?\]

NA

\
**Statistical metrics**

\[Please provide detail on the statistical method used in your calibration - E.g. optimisation, error terms\]

log-likelihood

**Statistical results (summary)**

\[Please provide a summary of the metrics and results associated with your model calibration - E.g. RMSE with observed catches and any other process-based or theoretical criteria used to calibrate the model, comparison of modelled biomass, growth rates, P”B ratios etc\]  

NA

**Model changes or  improvements(s) made as a result of calibration**

\[Please provide detail of any other parameters or model changes since the last round as a result of this calibration\]

The parameters being fit are primarily related to the predator-prey functional response. 

\
**ADDITIONAL DETAILS FOR REGIONAL MODELS ONLY:**

**Downscaling method**

\

\[Please describe further details how the LME level fishing effort was downscaled to your region, providing further information on what data, if any were used, E.g. \]  

Historic commercial fisheries catch are based on observed catch data as recorded in regional management documents and databases. Downscaling of catch was not necessary as the model boundaries were designed to be spatially consistent with existing management and catch reporting areas. Thus, no adjustments to catch (or effort) were necessary.

\

**The “base” year range of the regional model**

\

\[If you expressed effort relative to the effort in your base model, which year was the base year and how was this done\] 

The model was calibrated to the early 1990s (1991–1994). Fishing effort was not expressed as relative to this time period.

\

**Environmental and biogeochemical variables and equations**

\

\[Please provide details about which climate forcing variables you use and how you integrate these into your model

-   which primary/ secondary producers variables

    -   We use biomass outputs for primary and secondary producers from a regional ocean and biogeochemical model (ROMSNPZ, Hermann et al. 2021, DSR2 194,doi:10.1016/j.dsr2.2021.104974) to force the biomass of corresponding groups in our Rpath model. Biomasses from the lower trophic level model are directly applied to corresponding groups in the Rpath model. The ROMSNPZ is driven by earth system models from CMIP6 and are forced with contrasting emission pathways under different socioeconomic scenarios (SSPs, Gidden et al. 2019, Geosci Model Dev 12, doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-1443-2019). The groups whose biomasses are forced in our Rpath model are, copepods, euphausiids, pelagic and benthic microbes, large phytoplankton, and small phytoplankton.

-   which temperature and other environmental variables\]

    -   We force the bioenergetics of groundfish groups with bottom temperatures from the ROMSNPZ model. We follow the method for applying temperature-dependent fish bioenergetics in Rpath developed by Heinichen et al. (2022, Ecol Model 466, doi:10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2022.109911). Thermal response parameters were retrieved from the literature and thermal response curves (i.e., Kitchell curves) were constructed to describe temperature dependent consumption of groundfish, and modified Arrhenius curves were constructed to describe temperature-dependent respiration of groundfish. The curves were adjusted to account for the temperature of the model’s base time period (i.e., Ecopath configuration) which allowed for consumption and respiration to increase above 1. The scaled consumption curve is used to modify effective predator biomass which is then input to the main consumption equations in dynamic simulations (i.e., Ecosim). The respiration curve is used to modify the fraction of energy that is devoted to respiratory costs in dynamic simulations.
