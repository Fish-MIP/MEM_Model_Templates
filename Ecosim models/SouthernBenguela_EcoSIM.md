# Spatial grid-cell allocation method

The temporally-dynamic Ecosim model was used in this round, thus not spatial (effort was considered applicable across the whole model area of the Southern Benguela).

# Fishing mortality rate equation

Fishing mortality was estimated as harvest proportion, i.e. Catch / Biomass

# Selectivity (size,age,species)

Not applicable

# Model calibration

Our Ecosim model was fitted to catch time series (per functional group fished), by means of residual sum of squares.

# Catchability and Creep (yearly rate of change catchability) Estimates

Not accounted for

# Further details on calibration

Our Ecosim model was fitted to estimates of abundance, derived from research surveys or cpue in the case of line fish species. This was undertaken by means of residual sum of squares.

# Statistical metrics

SS and AIK

# Statistical results (summary)

Model calibration was done via fitting considering residual sum of squares reduction. 

# Model changes or  improvements(s) made as a result of calibration

The initial model incorporated the following environmental series to improve model fitting and derive \"vulnerability\" parameters to quantify predator-prey interactions. **These two environmental series were subsequently not used for FishMIP simulations (see \"Environmental and biogeochemical variables and equations\" below),** but the vulnerabilities were retained to capture likely to-down/bottom-up interactions between pairs of functional groups. 

The Large Phytoplankton functional group was driven by a forcing function derived from a cumulative upwelling index (Lamont et al. 2018)

\* Lamont, T., García-Reyes, M., Bograd, S. J., van der Lingen, C. D., and Sydeman, W. J. (2018). Upwelling indices for comparative ecosystem studies: variability in the Benguela upwelling system. J. Mar. Syst. 188, 3--16. doi: 10.1016/J.JMARSYS. 2017.05.007

Hypothetical model-derived forcing functions were searched for and used to adjust small phytoplankton. 

No additional changes to model parameters during fitting, over and above these.

# ADDITIONAL DETAILS FOR REGIONAL MODELS ONLY:

## Downscaling method

We used regionally-available (data-derived) fishing effort for our simulations rather than ESM-derived, up until 2015, then projected at 2015 levels for future years.

## The \"base\" year range of the regional model

1978-2015, with base effort for the future projections set to 2015 effort values.

## Environmental and biogeochemical variables and equations

Climatic scenarios were forced in Ecosim by means of a forcing function comprising of relative change (to 1978) applied to productivity of our large phytoplankton group, (the FF was calculated as a relative series using the actual PP values from ESMs).

In addition, climate scenarios were modelled to incorporate the effect of temperature on foraging of nine key, well known groups (for which we have multi-stanzas, incidently) to temperature:

Anchovy recruits -- temperature in the upper 30/50m water column West of Cape Agulhas

Anchovy adults - temperature in the upper 30/50m water column East of Cape Agulhas

Sardine adults (recruit distribution has varied greatly between coasts and B is sometimes very low) - temperature in the upper 30/50m water column East of Cape Agulhas

Horse mackerel juveniles - temperature in the upper 30/50m water column West of Cape Agulhas 

Horse mackerel adults - temperature in the upper 30/50m water column East of Cape Agulhas

Small shallow-water Cape Hake (Merluccius capensis) -- bottom temperature West of Cape Agulhas 

Large shallow-water Cape Hake (Merluccius capensis) -- bottom temperature East of Cape Agulhas 

Small deep-water Cape Hake (Merluccius paradoxus) -- bottom temperature West of Cape Agulhas 

Large deep-water Cape Hake (Merluccius paradoxus) -- bottom temperature West of Cape Agulhas \
